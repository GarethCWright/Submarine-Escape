DIALOGUE = {
"firstroom_enter": """
You wake up on a submarine with a group of insufferable billionaires on their way to see the wreckage of the Titanic. Seems like a bad idea. Seems like tempting fate. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a programmer writing a dumb game.

One girl - 20 years old - has never heard of the Titanic. 

'Is that like, a fish?'

She's only here because she didn't want to do another yacht vacation with her fmaily.

One guy starts talking to you about bitcoin. He hasn't actually made any money on it, but that doesn't matter because he was born rich.

Another billionaire complains that no one's offered him a drink yet. Where's the scotch?

You feel your brain melting the longer you interact with these people. You need to get away.
""",


"firstroom_shoot": """
You draw your gun and aim for the most annoying billionaire. Just as you shoot he cranes his neck to ogle the 20-year-old. The bullet ricochets off the wall and kills you instantly.
""",


"firstroom_taxes": """
You can't believe the things these people are saying. How are THESE the wealthiest people on the planet?

'We need a wealth tax.'

You say it out loud. Big mistake.

Suddenly the billionaires all turn into giant reptilian monsters with burning red eyes. They hiss and growl at you.

'The government has no right to our money!'
'Taxes are for poor people!'
'We're too smart to pay taxes!'

They pounce and tear you to shreds. You are dead.
""",


"firstroom_drinks": """
You use your excellent people skills and agree with the billionaire that the service on this submarine is atrocious.

'I'm gonna see about getting us some drinks."

You say it indignantly and they love it. You step away and find yourself in the control room.
""",


"controlroom_enter": """
In the control room you find the submarine specs and realize it was not built to descend such depths. It will probably implode soon. Do you tell the billionaires or try to escape on your own?
""",


"tell_billionaires": """
Because you're such a good person, you go back and tell the billionaires, but they don't take you seriously.

'This submarine was built with state-of-the-art technology. One ticket cost a quarter million dollars. You expect me to believe some little pissant telling me it's no good?'

You tell them about the specs. They start to worry but try to hide. You decide to capitalize on this.

'I can probably get us off this submarine... for the right price.'

You request $1 million. They scoff.

'Tell you what, sport. Here's five bucks. Get us off this submarine, and I'll give you another five.'

Is this guy for real? You look at him in disbelief.

'That's not even minimum wage.'

'That's the market rate. There's no minimum wage in international waters, so the market has determined that the price for "saving our lives" is $5.'

You look at the others. They nod in agreement.

'If you don't like it, we'll just get the Mexican to do it.'

What Mexican? You can't believe these people. You roll your eyes and leave.
""",


"escapepod_enter_alone": """
You find the escape pod, but it needs two people to operate it, which seems like a poor design choice.

You also notice some pigs behind a glass door. Why are they here?? Their trough appears empty. The door is locked with a keypad.

Anyway. What are you going to do about this escape pod?
""",


"ask_billionaires": """
You find the least annoying billionaire and ask for help. He is predictably unhelpful and you die.
""",


"donttell_billionaires": """
You don't tell the billionaires. Fuck 'em. They can die for all you care.
""",


"engineroom_enter": """
You look around and find the engine room where Paco the Mexican is doing the job of three people. He's sweaty and stressed.

You try explaining that the submarine is going to explode.

'Si se√±or, trabajo en el submarino.'

His english is not so good. You try again.

'This submarino explodo.'

You make an exploding motion with your hands.

'Submarino pccht. Explodo.'

You point to Paco and back at yourself.

'We go now. Or we die.'

You make a dead face. His English is not so good and your Spanish is abysmal, but he gets it. He follows you out just as an emergency alert blares through the submarine.
""",


"escapepod_enter_paco": """
You and Paco race to the escape pod and start to enter the controls. 

Unfortunately the billionaires also heard the alert and have found the escape pod as well. It only holds two people.
""",


"escapepod_tripwire": """
You activate a tripwire to stop the billionaires Unfortunately you're too close when they trigger it and you explode along with them.
""",


"escapepod_pigs": """
Your mind goes to the pigs. You need a five-digit code to open the door. Your mind goes blank. Only one set of digits comes to mind.
""",

"keypad_fail": """
'BZZZT!'
Incorrect. The wealthy mob gets you and you die.
""",


"keypad_guess": """
The keypad beeps green and you hear the click of the door unlocking. 

You open the door, releasing the hungry pigs. They instantly sense the billionaires' disdain and attack them. The pigs eat the billionaires alive. Oof. What a way to go.

You and Paco get into the escape pod and jettison away to safety moments before the submarine implodes.

Congratulations! You win.
